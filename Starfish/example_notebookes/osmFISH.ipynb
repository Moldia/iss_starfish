    "## Reproduce Published osmFISH results with Starfish\n",
    "\n",
    "osmFISH is an image based transcriptomics technique that can spatially resolve tens of RNA transcripts and their expression levels in-situ. The protocol anddata analysis are described in this [publication](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-018-0175-z). This notebook walks through how to use Starfish to process the raw images from an osmFISH experiment into a spatially resolved gene expression image. We verify taht Starfish can accurately reproduce the results from the authors' original Python [pipeline](http://linnarssonlab.org/osmFISH/image_analysis/)\n",

    "Decoding in a non-multiplexed image based transcriptomics method is equivalent to simple spot finding, since each spot in each color channel and round corresponds to a different gene. To find spots in osmFISH data, the authors employ a peak finder that distinguishes local maxima from their surroundings whose absolute intensities exceed a threshold value. It tests a number of different thresholds, building a curve from the number of peaks detected at each threshold. A threshold in the _stable region_ or _knee_ of the curve is selected, and final peaks are called with that threshold.\n",
